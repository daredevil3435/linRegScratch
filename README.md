### Linear Regression from scratch

Linear regression is the first method we learn when we start our Machine Learning journey. To understand it deeply I have tried to implement it from scratch. 
we can represent line on x-y plane as :
    `y = mx + c`

where,
`m` = slope of line
`c` = intecept on y-axis
    
In this approach we use Mean Squared Error. We take partial derivative of mse formula with respect to m and c.
